Drugs And Trial (DAT) 

Application Concept: Blind Drug Trials Platform
In a blind trial platform, different entities are involved to ensure data management for clinical trials, patients, drugs, trial administrators, and results. The platform would have users who can manage trials and participants while ensuring that patients are unaware of the details of the drugs they receive.
